# covid_tracking
Early in the pandemic (before the data feeds @ jhu.edu were complete), The Atlantic had the most reliable COVID stats at https://covidtracking.com/.  I wrote some quick (& very unstructured) python to download CSVs from covidtracking.com &amp; email me 2x/day plots+tables of the most recent case counts & death counts for selected US states &amp; overall USA stats.

As of March 2021, these feeds no longer work.
